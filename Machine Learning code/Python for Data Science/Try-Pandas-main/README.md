# Try Pandas
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a great tool for doing analysis on spreadsheets.

It's easy to say that but let's actually learn why by doing something real.

We're going to be analyzing [NBA](https://www.nba.com/stats/) data to help understand why Pandas should be a tool in your data science toolkit.

But more importantly, doing something practical will help you better understand the need for a tool like Pandas.

To help us work with Pandas in a practical way, we've teamed up with [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/referral?token=cfe). [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/referral?token=cfe) is a service that makes it easy to run interactive notebooks (also known as Juptyer Notebooks). These notebooks allow us to run Python & Pandas in a highly visual and highly interactive manner.

What's better, notebooks, especially on [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/referral?token=cfe), allow non-technical team members to participate in a code-heavy document (as we'll see how).

To get started, sign up for Deepnote using this [link](https://deepnote.com/referral?token=cfe) (This link will unlock pro features).

Once you [sign up](https://deepnote.com/referral?token=cfe), you can automagically copy all the code in this repo with the following button:
